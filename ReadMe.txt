This is a two part project. 

Part one sniffs a packet capture and reports information such as # of packets, packet types, and top five sessions. It displays a graph to illustrate traffic flows during the capture.

Part two sifts through the same traffic in search of image files and scans them using facial recognition. If a face is detected in an image file, it highlights the face, and extracts the new image to a file.
